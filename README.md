# Lumen Microservice 

Lumen is a PHP micro-framework built to deliver microservices and blazing fast APIs.


Lumen is an open-source PHP micro-framework created by Taylor Otwell as an alternative to Laravel to meet the demand of lightweight installations that are faster than existing PHP micro-frameworks such as Slim and Silex. With Lumen, you can build lightning-fast microservices and APIs that can support your Laravel applications.
